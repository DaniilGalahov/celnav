TODO:
+ 1) implement precession (+) and nutation (+) corrections for RaDec (+)
+ 1.5) Understand what's the source of shit with precision (i.e., does the ephemerides getting in count refraction or no)? (+)
+ 2) rewrite precession and nutation systems for usage in astropy version (or apply there its own correction)
5) implement new precise ephemeris for Moon

Logic of package.
We need to provide math support for basic navigational tasks. I.e., following common logic:
1. Determine our current position using available data sources, esp.:
+1.1. From 3 known positions and 3 azimuths to them (P3Z3)
+1.4. From 3 known positions, and 3 ranges to them (P3R3)
+1.5. Using celestial navigation methods (2 object fix or 3 object fix)
(all other types of position determination requires detection of direction to north, which in any case requires detection of position - to calculate azimuth to star or to determine magnetic compass correction through polynominal)

2. Determine required heading, esp.:
+2.1. Plot a orthodromy from determined position to required position.
+2.2. Determine required heading at our current position of orthodromy.

3. Determine current true heading, esp.:
+3.1. calculating required magnetic heading through calculation true (astronomic) azimuth from current position to a star and comparing it with actual azimuth
+3.2.  required magnetic heading through calculation true (geometric) azimuth from current position to known position, and comparing it with actual azimuth

4. Determine DR, esp.:
+4.1. Determine DR through speed, direction, drift speed, drift direction and time.
