TODO:
+ 1) implement precession (+) and nutation (+) corrections for RaDec (+)
+ 1.5) Understand what's the source of shit with precision (i.e., does the ephemerides getting in count refraction or no)? (+)
+2) rewrite precession and nutation systems for usage in astropy version (or apply there its own correction)
3) implement star compass and correction of magnetic declination
+ 4) implement system to calculate great circle flights
5) implement new precise ephemeris for Moon
